 In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

 **Objectives:**
 
 + List popular languages for Data Science
 + Common used libraries in Data Science
 + Data Science Tools
 + Few arithmetic expressions
 

 Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
 
     1. Python
     2. R programming language
     3. Scala
     4. Java
     5. C++
     6. Julia 

 Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
 
    1. Python - Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and MatPotlib.
    2. R - dplyr, stringr, ggplot, and  caret.
    3. Scala - Shark, MLlib, GraphX, and Spark streaming.
    4. Java - Java-ML, Apache MLlib, and Deeplearning4.
    5. C++ - TensorFlow, MongoDB, and Caffe.
    6. Julia - JuliaDB.
